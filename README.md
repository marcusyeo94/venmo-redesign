REDESIGNING VENMO - README

# Objective #

This is a UI/UX design project where I attempt to improve Venmo's existing user interface (ver 6.20.3 when I started the project).

I used the following usability criteria to (1) analyse the existing interface, and (2) design a hi-fi mockup of (what I believe) is a more user-centric alternative.

* Intuitive design: a nearly effortless understanding of the architecture and navigation of the interface
* Ease of learning: how fast a user who has never seen the UI before can accomplish basic tasks
* Efficiency of use: how fast an experienced user can accomplish tasks
* Memorability: how effectively a user can use an interface on future visits
* Error frequency and severity: how often users make errors while using the system, how serious the errors are, and how users recover from the errors
*Subjective satisfaction: whether the user likes using the system

Included is a written and illustrated explanation of my redesign choices, and images of the app pages I designed.

The interactive prototype based off my redesign is available here:

# Tools #

I used Sketch to construct the hi-fi static screens, and Quant.ux to create a click-through prototype.

# Improvements #

I'd love to know what you thought of my redesigns! This is my first proper attempt at UI/UX design, and any feedback would be much appreciated! Feel free to leave a comment on the prototype (click the message button and select an area to comment on), or drop me a message.
